# pytm extensions
## This is an Github repository for threat analysis
Base of this is the [tool pytm by izar](https://github.com/izar/pytm).
To make it more userfriendly I added a shell script.
Usage is:
'''console
user@ubuntu: sh generateoutput.sh tm.py sequenzdiagram.png report.html dfddiagram.png '''
Files are saved in folder Output.
You can change the names of the output files (the arguments in commandline).
### IF you change argument dfddiagram.png you also have to change the name in /docs/template.md in row 12
Why does this git exist?
Add repo changes to use it as location for docker container.
